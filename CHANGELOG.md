# Changelog

## v1.0.5
- Fixed a 500 error (FieldError on 'children') on the budget breakdown edit page,
  triggered when the Local Church Budget fund was matched by its full name rather
  than an 'LCB ' prefix. The query now uses the correct 'subgroups' relation.

## v1.0.4
- Update checker now authenticates with an optional GITHUB_TOKEN, so it can read
  releases from a PRIVATE GitHub repository (the unauthenticated API returns 404
  for private repos).
- Fixed: the release check was cached permanently per process, so a new release
  was not noticed until the app restarted. It now re-checks at most every 10
  minutes, and the update page forces a fresh check.

## v1.0.3
- Import dedup now also matches on the M-Pesa receipt (mpesa_ref), catching a
  repeated payment even when one row has a core_ref and another does not.
- New 'dedupe_transactions' management command finds and removes existing
  duplicate transactions sharing an M-Pesa receipt (keeps the better record,
  repoints envelopes/expenses). Dry-run by default; --apply to perform.
- Statement purge gained an 'Unlink & purge' option: it clears the
  reconciliation links on any expenses tied to the statement's debits (keeping
  the expenses) instead of refusing outright.

## v1.0.2
- Statement dedup keys (core_ref / M-Pesa receipt) are normalised to uppercase,
  so duplicate detection is exact regardless of the database collation. Fixes
  false/inconsistent duplicate counts on MySQL databases created with a
  case-insensitive collation such as latin1_swedish_ci.

## v1.0.1
- Test release to validate the in-app update mechanism.
- Added a visible "What's new" note on the Settings → About tab so an applied
  update is easy to confirm.
- Database backup is now engine-aware (SQLite file / MySQL & Postgres dump).
- Importer creates a system user automatically on a fresh database, so the
  legacy import no longer fails on a brand-new deployment.
- `.env` is auto-loaded by the app (no fragile shell `export` needed).
- Production: WhiteNoise static serving, health check at /healthz/, gunicorn
  config, logging, and cPanel/WHM deployment runbook.

## v1.0.0
- Initial release: full SDA church treasury system — member giving, fund
  allocation, bank/M-Pesa reconciliation, trust remittances, expenses,
  departmental reporting, and audit logging.
