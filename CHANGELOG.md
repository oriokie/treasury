# Changelog

## v1.0.11
- Redesigned the envelope ledger entry screen (Record envelopes) for faster,
  clearer entry: a cleaner toolbar, a live summary bar showing the running
  contributor count, grand total, and per-fund subtotals as you type, a sticky
  column-totals footer row, a clearer Save button showing the total, and an
  inline duplicate-name flag. All existing behaviour (name autocomplete,
  auto-incrementing receipts, keyboard navigation, fund picker, Excel template)
  is preserved.
- Confirmed SMS/WhatsApp receipt buttons on the envelopes list appear only when
  the matching channel is enabled in settings.

## v1.0.10
- Per-Sabbath Excel sheet cleanups:
  - Receipt numbers display without the internal month/sabbath prefix (e.g.
    "JUN1-0421" now shows as "0421").
  - Combined Offering and Thanksgiving Offering appear as a single block (the
    full amount given) in the per-contributor entries table, but are split into
    their trust and local halves in the summary table.
  - The summary table now has cell borders, matching the entries table.

## v1.0.9
- Statement imports now capture the statement's own opening/closing running
  balance and date span.
- New "Bank position check" report (Reports → Bank position check): compares the
  system's computed bank balance (opening + bank receipts − bank payments) against
  the most recent statement's closing balance. A non-zero difference means an
  entry is on the statement but not in the app (or vice versa) — the report lists
  the likely culprits (unconfirmed, in-review, or unallocated bank entries) so
  they can be chased. Directly addresses un-entered bank entries going undetected.

## v1.0.8
- New per-transaction "Receipt" action on the transactions list: receipt a single
  bank/M-Pesa gift as an envelope on demand (the per-entry counterpart to the bulk
  monthly pull). Supports a user-entered receipt number for hybrid manual
  receipting, so the system record matches a hand-written receipt/envelope; leave
  it blank to auto-assign. Split parts of one gift are receipted together, the
  bank transaction is linked, and it is marked accounted-for so income is never
  double-counted. (Items 7 + 8.)

## v1.0.7
- Reconciliation variance finder rewritten to explain real-world differences:
  it now compares each fund's engine contribution against what is actually
  posted in the ledger, catching transactions that were re-allocated to another
  fund, edited, excluded, reversed, or unconfirmed after posting — not just
  entries that were never posted. The flagged amounts now sum to the variance,
  and a one-click "Rebuild ledger" button on the page re-posts everything from
  current source records to clear it.

## v1.0.6
- Transactions Excel export now includes M-Pesa ref, core ref, bank receipt,
  member, phone, dev group, service Sabbath and confirmed status.
- SMS and WhatsApp send buttons on the envelopes page appear only when those
  channels are enabled in settings.
- The per-Sabbath Excel sheet now carries the church name, has cell borders,
  number formatting, and a print-ready landscape layout (fit-to-width, repeating
  headers, page footer).
- New reconciliation variance finder: when a fund's engine balance differs from
  the general ledger, click "investigate" to see the actual transactions and
  expenses causing the difference.
- M-Pesa webhook ingest now normalises dedup keys to uppercase (collation-safe),
  consistent with the statement importer.
- Mobile layout: tables scroll within their cards instead of forcing the page
  wide; tighter padding and wrapping on small screens.

## v1.0.5
- Fixed a 500 error (FieldError on 'children') on the budget breakdown edit page,
  triggered when the Local Church Budget fund was matched by its full name rather
  than an 'LCB ' prefix. The query now uses the correct 'subgroups' relation.

## v1.0.4
- Update checker now authenticates with an optional GITHUB_TOKEN, so it can read
  releases from a PRIVATE GitHub repository (the unauthenticated API returns 404
  for private repos).
- Fixed: the release check was cached permanently per process, so a new release
  was not noticed until the app restarted. It now re-checks at most every 10
  minutes, and the update page forces a fresh check.

## v1.0.3
- Import dedup now also matches on the M-Pesa receipt (mpesa_ref), catching a
  repeated payment even when one row has a core_ref and another does not.
- New 'dedupe_transactions' management command finds and removes existing
  duplicate transactions sharing an M-Pesa receipt (keeps the better record,
  repoints envelopes/expenses). Dry-run by default; --apply to perform.
- Statement purge gained an 'Unlink & purge' option: it clears the
  reconciliation links on any expenses tied to the statement's debits (keeping
  the expenses) instead of refusing outright.

## v1.0.2
- Statement dedup keys (core_ref / M-Pesa receipt) are normalised to uppercase,
  so duplicate detection is exact regardless of the database collation. Fixes
  false/inconsistent duplicate counts on MySQL databases created with a
  case-insensitive collation such as latin1_swedish_ci.

## v1.0.1
- Test release to validate the in-app update mechanism.
- Added a visible "What's new" note on the Settings → About tab so an applied
  update is easy to confirm.
- Database backup is now engine-aware (SQLite file / MySQL & Postgres dump).
- Importer creates a system user automatically on a fresh database, so the
  legacy import no longer fails on a brand-new deployment.
- `.env` is auto-loaded by the app (no fragile shell `export` needed).
- Production: WhiteNoise static serving, health check at /healthz/, gunicorn
  config, logging, and cPanel/WHM deployment runbook.

## v1.0.0
- Initial release: full SDA church treasury system — member giving, fund
  allocation, bank/M-Pesa reconciliation, trust remittances, expenses,
  departmental reporting, and audit logging.
